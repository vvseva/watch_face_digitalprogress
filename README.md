# watch_face_digitalprogress

An 10 minutes design of a digital watch face where each number acts as a barchart (progress bar) to not only communicate a nubmer, but also that helps to make sense of what part of hour is gone. The design is heavily inspired by Technology Connextras's [video "So... the minute hand shows progression â€” apparently we think of time in wildly different ways"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeopkvAP-ag)

### Future work

add ticks and seconds?

### Demo
